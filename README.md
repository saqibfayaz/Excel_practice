This is my first excel full project where i have used a raw data file, cleaned it, added columns by using functions to make data more understandable and usable for further examination. 
Then used pivot tables to answer some questions related to data about "Bike Sales DataSet". 
Used Different charts to compare with each other to understand the dynamics of data.
The made a single page Dashboard and added slicing filters to make dashboard more interactive . NOTE:- i haven't used slicing in my current project due to it's inavailability in Office 2007.
But i know how to do it.

I am a learner, i am learning. 
Thanks.
